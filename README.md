summit-email-templates
----------------------

Templates for e-mail notifications sent by the Summit research administration system.

Templates use a combination of Markdown and [Freemarker] (http://freemarker.org) syntax.

Creating folders for related notification templates is _highly recommended_.  For example, you could have a folder named `approval` which contains all of your e-mail notification templates that will be sent regarding approvals.

A file containing an e-mail template should have the suffix `.md` indicating that it contains Markdown formatted text.
