Any award granted as a result of an unauthorized Proposal Submission is subject to rejection by the university. In order for the university to consider acceptance of an award resulting from an unauthorized submission, the Principal Investigator must submit an explanation to the Office of Sponsored Programs as to the nature of and reasons for the unauthorized submission. Awards will not be accepted until the explanation has been received/approved by by OSP management.

In addition to receiving approval from OSP management, an official proposal must be created in Summit, before Pre-Award can move forward with processing the award and establishing a fund number.

2. Attach all documents that you originally submitted to the sponsor as your proposal (statement of work, budget, etc) to the corresponding proposal in Summit, so that all appropriate requirements can be obtained, Pre Award can review the proposal, and it can be routed for approval.
3. Work in Summit with your assigned Pre-Award Associate to finalize an OSP approved budget for this project.
4. Once an accepted and approved budget has been obtained and all outstanding requirements in Summit have been fulfilled, submit the proposal for routing in Summit.
