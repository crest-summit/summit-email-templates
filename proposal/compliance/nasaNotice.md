Please be advised that NASA funded research agreements are reviewed by the Office of Export and Secure Research Compliance (OESRC) due to the high risk of intersection with export control laws, particularly the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Numerous criteria must be met to ensure that your project is unrestricted/fundamental research.
