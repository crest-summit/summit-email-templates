(Principal Investigator),

This email contains important information and instructions related to the submission of your proposal, (Proposal Label), to (Sponsor); please read this message in its entirety.     

You are receiving this email because your upcoming proposal, (Proposal ID), involves Public Health Service (PHS) or PHS flow-through funds.

On August 10, 2012, Virginia Tech implemented the new provisions of the VT Conflict of Interest policy #13010 . VT policy #13010 addresses the federal requirement that any Financial Conflicts of Interests (FCOI) be disclosed before a PHS or PHS flow-through proposal can be submitted to the sponsor for funding consideration.  The policy also addresses the requirement for all investigators to complete training on Conflicts of Interest and provide 3rd Party Travel Reimbursement Disclosures prior to the award of a grant or contract.  Please note that this required FCOI information is being gathered to ensure  compliance with a federal requirement .

Before your proposal can be submitted to the sponsoring agency, current and complete documentation regarding FCOI must be received by OSP. This federal requirement applies to all investigators and external entities, both paid and unpaid, including but not limited to VT faculty & staff, collaborators, subcontractors, and consultants.  If you anticipate having external entities working on the proposed project (even if they will not be receiving funding support from the sponsor) please notify your Pre Award Administrator immediately.   

To help you meet the deadlines outlined in the OSP Proposal Submission policy, you will begin receiving reminder emails two business days before your proposal’s target due date.

Should you have any questions, please login to Summit to communicate with the assigned Pre Award Associate for this proposal.
