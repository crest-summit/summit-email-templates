Please be advised that DoD funded research agreements are reviewed by the Office of Export and Secure Research Compliance (OESRC) due to the high risk of intersection with export control laws, particularly the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Numerous criteria must be met to ensure that your project is unrestricted/fundamental research.  


------------------------------------------------------------------------


**ACTION REQUIRED:**  

* Review the [Attachment A: Memo to Faculty Proposing Research Funded by DoD](https://oesrc.researchcompliance.vt.edu/sites/oesrc.researchcompliance.vt.edu/files/attachment_a_dod_memo.pdf)
* Login to Summit (summit.vt.edu) and answer the following questions in the OESRC compliance subsection of proposal ${proposal.identifier}
    * As defined in the OESRC Attachment A, Is this Fundamental Research?
    * Would you like to include the "dual use" developmental items language?


------------------------------------------------------------------------


If you choose not to include this language, it is likely that your project will have export control requirements due to sponsor imposed agreement terms or U.S. Government regulations.  If you have any questions regarding export control or fundamental research, please [contact the OESRC](http://www.oesrc.researchcompliance.vt.edu/Contacts/) directly.
