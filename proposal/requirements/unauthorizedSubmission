Any award granted as a result of an unauthorized Proposal Submission is subject to rejection by the university. In order for the university to consider acceptance of an award resulting from an unauthorized submission, the Principal Investigator must submit an explanation to the Vice President for Research as to the nature of and reasons for the unauthorized submission. Awards will not be accepted until the explanation has been received/approved by the Assistant Vice President for Sponsored Programs Administration. Additionally, an OSP budget must be drafted, accepted and approved, and all proposal requirements in Summit must be completed. The exact copy of the proposal that was submitted to the sponsor should be attached to the proposal in Summit and the final budget and completed proposal package must be routed and approved in Summit.

The Director of PreAward, Mrs. Lauren Magruder, can approve on behalf of the VP for Research so the written explanation should be to her attention.  In addition to receiving approval from the Director of Pre-Award, an official proposal  must be created in Summit, before Pre-Award can move forward with processing the award and establishing a fund number.
